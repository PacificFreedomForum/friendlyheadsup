PFF. Pacific Freedom Forum

Pacific Freedom Forum is an NGO registered in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, the crossroad of Polynesia. 

PFF is a FOE to nearly all forms of any kind of censorship; public or private 

FOE. Freedom of Expression

Method. Ethics include a respect for privacy, and adhere to academic concepts of no harm. Although the truth hurts sometime, it never harms. This page is under an open newsroom TTT * policy. 

Benefit. Our PFF contributions here at Github focus exclusively on free, simple, software. This is so our Forum may help spread use of software reliably effective in often challenging IT environments that endure, across the world's largest feature, the Pacific Ocean.
